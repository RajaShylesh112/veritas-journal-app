### Product Brief: The Veritas Protocol

**1. Vision & Mission**

*   **Vision:** To create a world where truth is discoverable and trustworthy, and where honest journalism is rewarded exponentially.
*   **Mission:** To build a simple, decentralized journalism platform where reputation has consequences, manipulation is expensive, and trust is earned, not claimed. Our guiding principle is that **"Honest journalism compounds."**can

**2. The Problem**

Journalists who tackle sensitive topics face a trilemma of risk:
1.  **Physical & Professional Danger:** Exposing powerful entities can lead to persecution, career backlash, and physical harm.
2.  **Censorship:** Centralized platforms can be pressured by governments or corporations to remove controversial content, silencing critical voices.
3.  **Unfair Compensation:** Journalists often receive only a fraction of the value their work generates, with intermediaries taking the majority.

The current media landscape lacks a platform that can simultaneously provide safety, freedom of speech, and direct financial reward for high-integrity journalism.

**3. Target Audience**

*   **Primary:** Journalists operating in high-stakes environments (investigative, political, conflict-zone) who require anonymity and censorship resistance.
*   **Secondary:** Readers worldwide who are disillusioned with mainstream media and seek transparent, verifiable, and community-vetted sources of information.

**4. Core Features (MVP)**

The Minimum Viable Product will be a decentralized application built on three core pillars:

*   **1. Anonymous & Unstoppable Publishing:**
    *   Journalists publish under pseudonymous wallet addresses.
    *   Content is hosted on a decentralized network, making it impossible for any single entity to delete.

*   **2. Stake-Backed Trust System:**
    *   To publish, a journalist must **stake** their own earned "Trust Tokens." This stake is lost if the community rules the article is misleading.
    *   Readers receive a weekly budget of "Trust Tokens" to "upvote" content they deem credible, increasing the journalist's reputation score.

*   **3. Decentralized Moderation & Compensation:**
    *   A community-driven **"Case Review System"** allows staked challenges against articles, with a jury of reputable users ruling on disputes.
    *   An **"Automatic Community Fund,"** open to public donation, automatically distributes financial rewards to journalists based on their net "Trust Score."

**5. Guiding Principle & Strategic Focus**

The project will adhere to one primary strategic filter for all decisions: **"Avoid adding features, governance, or complexity until this core survives reality."**

The initial focus is not on competing with major news sites, but on perfecting the core mechanics of stake-backed trust and decentralized accountability. The first priority is to build and stress-test this core lifecycle to ensure it is resilient against manipulation.
