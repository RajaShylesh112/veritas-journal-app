# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2026-01-13
**Facilitator:** Elite Brainstorming Specialist Carson
**Participant:** BMad

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** A new blockchain-based project.

**Session Goals:** Uncertain about what problem to solve; looking for ideas and broad exploration.

**Techniques Used:** {{techniques_list}}

**Total Ideas Generated:** {{total_ideas}}

### Key Themes Identified:

- **Stake-Backed Trust:** Moving beyond simple voting to a system where credibility is backed by real commitment ("skin in the game").
- **Decentralized Accountability:** Creating a system that is resistant to both censorship from the outside and manipulation from the inside.
- **Compounding Honesty:** Designing a virtuous cycle where trustworthy behavior is automatically and exponentially rewarded.

## Technique Sessions

**1. Analogical Thinking:**
- **Initial Analogy:** Blockchain is like an "NGO or some anonymous group."
- **Core Value Identified:** "All are equal - it's a direct connection."
- **Problem Explored:** The opposite of this value, "Monopolies controlling the market."
- **Solution Pathway:** This led to the core idea of a decentralized marketplace for creators, which was then refined for journalists.

**2. "What If" Scenarios:**
- **Initial Prompt:** What if the platform had an unlimited budget?
- **User Ambition:** To compete directly with major national news sites.
- **Key Constraint Identified:** The user wisely decided to pull back from this ambition to focus on a simple, achievable Core MVP, demonstrating a crucial strategic insight.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_This is the Core MVP (Minimum Viable Product) plan for the **Decentralized Stake-Backed Journalism Platform**._

- **Identity:** An anonymous platform where journalists use wallet addresses as identities.
- **Reputation & Curation:** Readers receive a limited weekly budget of "Trust Tokens" to vote on good articles. This generates a visible "Trust Score."
- **Commitment (Staking):** To publish, a journalist must "stake" a number of their own earned tokens. This stake is lost if the community rules the article is misleading.
- **Compensation:** An automatic, community-replenished fund pays journalists based on the net "Trust" they've earned.
- **Decentralized Justice:** A "Case Review System" where staked challenges can be opened against articles, with a jury of reputable users voting on the outcome.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research after the MVP is successful._

- A decentralized editing and fact-checking system run by trusted community members.
- An automated fact-checking system to supplement community verification.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative long-term goals._

- Expanding into different content categories (culture, tech, etc.).
- Becoming a direct competitor to major national news sites.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session._

- The initial "Trust Score" idea was good, but felt incomplete. The user's instinct led to the breakthrough realization that a balancing mechanism—a negative consequence for bad behavior—was needed.
- The concept of "Staking" (requiring "skin in the game") was the key that unlocked the entire model, making the platform's trust system robust.
- The principle that **"Honest journalism compounds"** became the core vision. The system is designed to create a virtuous cycle where integrity is the primary driver of success.
- The user demonstrated strong strategic thinking by shifting from expansive "What If" scenarios back to a focused MVP when they felt the project was becoming too complex.
